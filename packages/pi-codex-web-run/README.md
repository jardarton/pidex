# pi-codex-web-run

Codex web search, page opening, link traversal, and in-page finding for ordinary Pi, Code Mode, and Notebook Mode.

## Install

    pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-codex-web-run

Requires Pi 0.84.4 or newer and Node.js 22.19 or newer.

Run `/login openai-codex` for the normal Codex route, including when chatting with another provider. Compatible active Codex transports keep their own credentials. Pi Codex's resolver is preferred when present, but its conversation-provider scope does not select tool endpoints. Neither Pi Codex nor an install script is required.

Pi Codex 3.0.25 or newer is optional. With it installed, the normal web_run tool becomes tools.web__run inside Code and Notebook Mode.

## Use

Use explicit search and navigation operations. Returned ref_ids belong to that search result and can be passed to open, click, or find. Cite the returned source URLs rather than internal ref_ids.

The Codex route uses GPT-6 Luna by default. Set `PI_CODEX_MODEL` to override it. Configured Responses routes keep their active configured model.

For a proxy that renames Codex providers or models, create `pi-codex-tools.json` in Pi's agent directory:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "company-codex": {
      "gpt-6-luna": "company-luna"
    }
  }
}
```

Each provider key identifies a Codex endpoint route. Its object maps the tool's canonical model names to that provider's aliases. Use an empty object when the provider renames no models.
